# Reports

This repository is dedicated to reporting content that appears on http://jsbin.com through the [issue tracker](/jsbin/reports/issues).

Either to report a bin that hosts content that is against our [terms of use](http://jsbin.com/legals) or against a [content policy](http://jsbin.com/legals/content-policy).

This repository is also used to raise issues where a bin is *incorrectly* reported (which can happen sometimes as some flagging is done automatically).

Please always include as much information as possible when filing issues.
